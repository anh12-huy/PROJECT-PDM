EMPLOYEE ATTENDANCE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
1. Overview
•	This project comprises the Frontend (FE) client and a Backend (BE) API for an Employee Attendance Management System.
•	FE Tech Stack: Vanilla JavaScript (ES Modules), HTML5, CSS. The FE is a Single Page Application (SPA).
•	BE Tech Stack: Assumed to be Java/Spring Boot.
•	The FE communicates with the BE via RESTful endpoints under /api/....
•	Core Features: User authentication, employee management, attendance tracking, department organization, shift management, and leave requests. Role-based access control (RBAC) is enforced by the BE and reflected in the FE UI.
2. Prerequisites
•	Backend API Server (BE) must be running.
o	Expected BE base URL: http://localhost:8081
o	Endpoints under /api/... must be available (e.g., /api/auth/login, etc.).
o	BE must allow CORS for origin http://localhost:8081 (if testing cross-origin requests).
•	A modern web browser supporting ES Modules (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, etc.).
•	Optional: Local development environment for debugging BE endpoints (e.g., Postman or curl).
3. Directory Structure (FE)
•	Root Directory
o	server.js (Node.js static server for FE)
o	UserLogin.html (Entry point)
o	Dashboard.html
o	Employees.html
o	Attendance.html
o	Department.html
o	Shifts.html
o	Holiday.html
o	LeaveRecords.html
o	API Test Helper.html (Debug/CORS helper)
o	css/
	styles.css (Global styles)
o	js/
	api.js (Fetch wrapper, auth headers)
	App.js (Common utilities: checkLogin, checkRole, getUser)
	SideBar.js (UI sidebar rendering)
4. How to Run
This section provides step-by-step instructions to run both FE and BE locally. Adjust ports or endpoints if your BE configuration differs.
Frontend (FE)
•	4.1 Start the FE server
o	Open a terminal and navigate to the FE project root (directory containing server.js and UserLogin.html).
o	Run the FE server:
o	Expected console output:
text
Frontend server running at http://localhost:8081  
•	4.2 Access FE in the browser
o	Open http://localhost:8081/UserLogin.html in your browser.
o	The FE will attempt to communicate with BE at http://localhost:8081/api/...
Backend (BE)
•	4.3 Ensure BE is running
o	Start your BE server (e.g., a Spring Boot application) on port 8081.
o	BE must expose endpoints under /api/ (e.g., /api/auth/login).
•	4.4 Be aware of CORS
o	If FE (8081) and BE (8081) are separate processes, BE must allow cross-origin requests from http://localhost:8081.
o	If CORS is not configured, FE requests will fail with CORS errors. Configure BE to allow origin http://localhost:8081 or enable a permissive CORS policy during development.
•	4.5 Verifying API connectivity
o	Use the included API Test Helper.html in FE to manually verify connectivity:
	Open http://localhost:8081/API Test Helper.html
	Use it to issue test requests to BE endpoints (e.g., POST /api/auth/login) and verify responses.
o	If the API Test Helper works, FE requests should also work.
•	4.6 Optional local orchestration
o	You can run FE and BE together in a single script (e.g., npm script or docker-compose) by creating scripts to start BE and FE sequentially.
5. Test Credentials (Default Data)
The following are sample credentials used to test FE/BE integration, illustrating Admin, Manager, and Employee roles. Use these accounts to verify role-based access behavior in the FE (where the UI shows/hides features based on role) and in the BE (where endpoints enforce permissions).
Important: These credentials are examples. Ensure your BE database is pre-populated accordingly, or adapt based on your actual seed data.
•	5.1 Admin (Admin role)
o	UserID: 1
o	Username/Email: admin@example.com (adjust to BE configuration)
o	Password: 123456
o	Role: Admin
o	Access rights (expected in BE and reflected in FE):
Full access across the system
Create/Edit/Delete Employees
Manage Departments, Shifts, Holidays
Approve/Deny Leave Requests
Mark attendance for all employees
o	Restrictions:
None (Admin has unrestricted access in this test scenario)
•	5.2 Manager (Manager role)
o	UserID: 2
o	Username/Email: manager@example.com
o	Password: 123456
o	Role: Manager
o	Access rights:
Dashboard overview for department
View attendance for self and department employees
View department employees
Approve/Deny leave requests for employees within their department
View their own profile
View holidays
o	Restrictions:
Cannot delete data
Cannot manage other employees outside their department
Cannot edit Departments/Shifts/Holidays
Cannot perform actions that require Admin permissions (e.g., global user management)
•	5.3 Employee (Employee role)
o	UserID: 3
o	Username/Email: employee@example.com
o	Password: 123456
o	Role: Employee
o	Access rights:
Check In / Check Out
Select Shift (Day, Night, Morning, Evening)
View personal attendance history
o	Restrictions:
Cannot edit or delete attendance
Cannot mark attendance for others
Cannot view/approve others' leave requests
6. File Descriptions (BE-agnostic)
•	server.js
o	Node.js static HTTP server to serve FE assets (HTML/CSS/JS).
o	Listens on port 8081.
•	UserLogin.html
o	Login (and registration) page. Submits POST /api/auth/login and stores JWT in localStorage.
•	Dashboard.html
o	Landing page after login; displays stats and quick actions.
•	Employees.html
o	Admin: CRUD for employees. Employee: view own profile.
•	Attendance.html
o	Admin: mark attendance for any employee. Employee: self-attendance controls.
o	Shows attendance history.
•	Department.html
o	Manage departments (Admin/Manager access).
•	Shifts.html
o	Define shifts (Start Time / End Time).
•	Holiday.html
o	Manage holidays.
•	LeaveRecords.html
o	Employee: submit leave requests.
o	Admin/Manager: approve/deny leave requests.
•	API Test Helper.html
o	Utility to troubleshoot FE-BE connectivity (CORS verification).
7. API Contract (Guidance, to be aligned with BE)
•	Authentication
o	POST /api/auth/login
Request: { username, password } (adjust fields to your BE)
Response: { token: "JWT", user: { id, role, name, ... } }
•	User/Profile
o	GET /api/users/me
Requires Authorization: Bearer <token>
Response: user profile including role 
•	Admin endpoints (examples; adapt to actual BE)
o	POST /api/employees
o	GET /api/employees
o	PUT /api/employees/{id}
o	DELETE /api/employees/{id}
o	GET /api/departments
o	POST /api/departments
o	etc.
•	Attendance
o	POST /api/attendance/checkin
o	POST /api/attendance/checkout
o	GET /api/attendance/history?userId=...
•	Leaves
o	POST /api/leaves
o	GET /api/leaves
o	POST /api/leaves/{id}/approve
o	POST /api/leaves/{id}/deny
•	Holidays, Shifts, etc.
o	Endpoints per BE design.
8. Running Notes & Troubleshooting
•	401 Unauthorized
o	Your session token may have expired. Logout or clear localStorage and re-login.
•	Network Error / Failed to fetch
o	Verify BE is running on port 8081.
o	Verify FE can reach BE (CORS, network).
•	CORS Errors
o	Ensure BE allows origin http://localhost:8081 (or disable CORS for development).
•	Token storage security
o	localStorage is susceptible to XSS. Consider BE-side HttpOnly cookies for production and update FE accordingly.
